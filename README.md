[![New Blog](https://www.hansking.cn/button/add.svg)](https://github.com/HansKing98/hans-nextjs-blog/new/main/data/posts/2024)

Personal blog based on NextJS and TailwindCSS, which is rebuilt from my [legacy gatsby version](https://github.com/HansKing98/hans-blog).

Thanks to [timlrx's starter](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), I don't need to manage data from scratch like dealing with tags in Gatsby.
